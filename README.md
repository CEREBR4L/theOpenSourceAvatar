# theOpenSourceAvatar
The real power of open source visually outlined

**Q:** What's the point of this, you ask?  

**A:** Absolutely Nothing  

**Q:** How does this work...what's the general idea?  
  
**A:** It's not that complicated, and there aren't really any specific rules *(other than keep it clean, keep it civil, and in somewhat good taste)* - and the general idea is to essentially, add on to avatar so that it *evolves to perfection*. You can add a new image; however, try to keep with the evolving nature and take what's currently there (avatar/image) and tweak it with your idea of creativity. GIMP, PHOTOSHOP, Whatever.  
  
**Have fun!**
